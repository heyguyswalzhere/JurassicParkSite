<h1>An Ode to Jurassic Park!</h1>

<p>Jurassic Park is one of my favorite movies of all time. 

<br>On this site, I'll tell you why.</p>



<h3>#1: The Dinosaurs!</h3>
When I was a kid, I watched any dinosaur movie I could get my hands on. There was a mom and pop video rental place right around the corner from my neighborhood, and I was there every weekend pulling down armfuls of dino movies from the shelves. King Kong, Godzilla, Gorgon…classic B movie creature features from the 1950’s on. I loved them all. But…Jurassic Park was the first film that I remember in which I was lik, woah, they did it. They made dinosaurs look and act just like I imagined they did.

<h3>#2: The Humans!</h3>
Jurassic Park reminded me a lot of Jaws at times, in that the movie wasn’t just about the creature(s). The human element was front and center in the film, and, as I’ve grown older, I’ve learned to appreciate all of the major themes that go along with what it means to be a human in a complicated world…even though I’ve never actually been chased by a dinosaur myself. I guess one of the enduring lessons of the movie I’ve learned is from the character Ian Malcolm: just because you can, doesn’t mean  you should…and control is really only an illusion. Chaos rules the realm. 


<h3>#3: The Memories!</h3>
Some of my favorite memories are centered around Jurassic Park. For one, family movie nights were a big part of my childhood. To this day, I love the excitement of going to a movie theater to see a film I’ve been wanting to see for weeks, if not months or years. And now, as a father, I get to experience seeing my kids watch the movies that I grew up watching. If you’d told nine-year-old Andrew Walz that 38 year-old Andrew Walz would be sitting here typing this up while waiting for the 6th JP franchise film to come out, he’d have been pretty stoked!
